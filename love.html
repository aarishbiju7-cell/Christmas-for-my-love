<h1>🎄 Merry Christmas My Love 🎄</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.7; margin-top:30px;">
This Christmas, I don’t wish for gifts, lights, or celebrations —  
because the greatest gift I have already is you.  
You are my peace on loud days, my strength on weak days,  
and my happiness in moments I never knew I needed.  
Every smile of yours feels like Christmas morning to my heart,  
and every moment with you feels like home.  
No matter where life takes us, I promise to choose you,  
love you, and stand by you — not just this Christmas,  
but for every season, every year, and every lifetime. ❤️🎄
